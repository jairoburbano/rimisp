                    Outputs from the Conference will serve as the basis for the preparation of a series of policy notes. Contributed draft papers will be reviewed and considered for inclusion in a book to be published by a major publisher and/or in a special issue of a major international journal. All submitted papers and PowerPoint presentations will be made available on this site.

                    About 80 invitation-only participants will share theories, research findings, development ideas, and private sector and public policy experiences through plenary sessions, and short presentations given in parallel sessions combined with a number of group discussions. All group discussions will be moderated and the moderators will prepare summaries of the debates and key emerging findings.
